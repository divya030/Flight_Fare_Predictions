**Summary** 

        This project aims to predict flight fares based on various features such as departure date and time, arrival date and time, total stops, airline, source, and destination. The prediction model is built using a RandomForestRegressor algorithm.

**Task**

        The task in this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the flight fares based on the given features. This will help travelers plan their trips more effectively and make informed decisions about flight bookings.

**Dataset Used** 

        The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains information about various flight routes, airlines, and their corresponding fares. 

**Insights**

1) "JET AIRWAYS" is the most demanding filght company.
2) The maximum price of tikcet was 79,512
3) The minimum price of ticket was 1759
4) The average price of ticket was 9,087.06
5) Least demanding flight is "GOAIR"
6) June is the peak month which means business will earn more profits whereas customers will face more rush in the specified month.
7) The more layover stops between source and destination , less the price of tickets.
8) We can see that their is zero to minimum earning of airline business in the months of February , July , August , October , November.
9) From different Sources the prices of flight tickets vary.
10) Delhi is the state which has the highest ticket price from source.

**Conclutions**

        This project demonstrates the development of a predictive model for flight fare estimation using machine learning techniques.The model can be used to make informed decisions about flight bookings and plan trips more effectively. The dataset used in the project is publicly available and sourced from Kaggle.
        Various feature selection and model building techniques were applied to create an accurate and reliable prediction model.The model's performance has been improved through feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, ensuring a better user experience and more accurate predictions.
        By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project provides valuable insights into predicting flight fares, empowering travelers to plan their trips efficiently and make informed decisions about their flight bookings.
